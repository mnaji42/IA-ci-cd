# GitHub Actions Workflows Templates

This repository includes ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

## test.yml
Runs unit tests automatically on every push and pull request.  
You can modify the trigger (e.g., only on main, only on PR, or on specific branches) by editing the `on:` section.

## lint.yml
Runs ESLint to check code quality and style on every push and pull request.  
Feel free to adjust the Node version, the lint command, or the trigger as needed.

## docs.yml
Generates the OpenAPI/Swagger documentation and uploads it as an artifact.  
You can adapt the doc generation command or choose to deploy the docs (e.g., to GitHub Pages) if needed.

### How to use/adapt these workflows:
- Copy the `.github/workflows/` folder into your project.
- By default, workflows run on every push and pull request to any branch.
- To change when they run, edit the `on:` section in each `.yml` file.
- You can add, remove, or rename workflow files to fit your project's needs.

> These workflow files are templates. Adapt them to your project's stack, branching strategy, and automation needs.
